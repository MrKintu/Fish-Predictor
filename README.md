# Classification with Support Vector Machines

## Overview
This project implements a classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyse and predict outcomes based on input data. The project involves loading a dataset, preprocessing it, and training an SVM model to classify the data.

## Objectives
- To load and preprocess data for analysis.
- To implement a Support Vector Machine model for classification.
- To evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
